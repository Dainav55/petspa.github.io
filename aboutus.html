      <h3>Our Background</h3>
      <p>Pawsh Paradise was founded with the goal of making pet care luxurious, accessible, and full of love. We’ve grown from a small team with a dream to a thriving community of animal lovers. Our story began with a single grooming table and a lot of heart. Today, we offer a full range of services including daycare, grooming, veterinary care, and more. We believe every pet deserves the highest level of care and pampering, and we’re dedicated to ensuring each visit is special. With a team of passionate professionals, we continue to build a sanctuary where pets and their humans feel welcomed and cared for like family.</p>
